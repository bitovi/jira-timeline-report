Support requests submitted outside business hours will be reviewed next business day.

## 3. Service Commitment

### Response Times:

- We aim to respond to all support requests within 24 business hours.

We strive to resolve minor issues within **1-2 business days**. More complex problems may take longer, and we will keep you informed throughout the resolution process.

## 4. Support Levels

### Support Channels:

- Email Support: statusreports@bitovi.com
- Live Chat: Join the [Bitovi Community Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/tw2kTV3vtQ) for discussions and real-time assistance.

### Prioritization Process:
We prioritize support requests based on the following factors:

- Impact on the customerâ€™s operations

- Customers with an active Support Entitlement Number (SEN)

Critical issues affecting multiple users will take precedence over non-urgent feature requests.
