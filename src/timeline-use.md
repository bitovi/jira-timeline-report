that can be put in a PowerPoint or Google Slide.

## Getting Started

Bitovi's [Agile Project Management with Jira - Reporting](https://www.bitovi.com/academy/learn-agile-program-management-with-jira/reporting.html) training walks through 
configuring the tool.

Note, your epics and initiatives will need the following statuses for the tool to work:

- `Idea`, `To Do`, or `Open` representing ideas that you might not want on the report.
- `QA` or `In QA` - represending work that is in QA.
- `Partner Review` or `UAT` - representing work that is in user acceptance testing.
- `Blocked` - represending work that can not move forward.
- `Done` or `Cancelled` - Work that is complete and will be hidden from the report.

The [Agile Project Management with Jira - Continuous Exploration](https://www.bitovi.com/academy/learn-agile-program-management-with-jira/continuous-exploration-board.html) training has 
videos on how to create an initiative type with the right statuses. 



## How Timing is Calculated

Initiative timing is calculated from __epic__ `Start date` and `Due date` fields. Initiative dates are _ignored_.
If the __epic__ does not have a `Start date` or `End date`, the stories within the __epic__ can be used to determine 
the timing of the __epic__. In this case, the latest story's end date will be used as the epic's `End date`
and the earliest story's start date will be used as the epic's `Start date`.

Story timing itself is determined from:

- The `Start date` and `End date` of the story; or if these don't exist
- The story's sprints




__NOTE:__ To use story timing, you must use a JQL that includes stories.  



## Labeling epics as QA or UAT

To label epics as part of an initiative's QA or UAT timing, add a `Label` that includes the characters `QA` or `UAT`.
